# automatic watering setup for a plant

This repository provides an electronic circuit board to water a plant. Is is driven by a microcontroller, an Attiny85, which gets the moldness of the soil in the pot from a sensor and powers a pump when it gets to dry.

In this repository you can find an electronic circuit board, designed in KiCad, as long as a firmware for the MCU and a 3d printable case. More documentation can be found on [my website](www.spice-space.de/inhalt/Pflanzenbewaesserung/index.html)
